Executing tasks periodically is crucial for many systems including packet processing systems.
This mini project demonstrates how to execute tasks periodically in multi threaded environment.

Build:
1. Download the source files and a header file into a directory.
2. copy the CMakeLists.txt and create a folder named build within the directory.
3. Within build directory, execute "cmake .." and "make" commands.
4. A binary called PeriodicTaskExample created within bin. Execute it to witness the output.

To compile and run the unit tests:
1. Create a directory(I named it as GoogleTest, you may name it as you like) for building: mkdir build
2. Change into the build directory: cd build
3. Generate the build files: cmake ..
4. Compile the unit tests: make
5. Run the unit tests: ./UnitTests
